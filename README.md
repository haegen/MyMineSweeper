# MyMinesSweeper
just started to program minesweeper

TO DO: 
  - clear method if no mine around (see original minesweeper)
  - include images (mine, exploding mine, flag, questionmark, smilie face (restart button))
  - by clicking a number, and (a) mine(s) is/are marked -> expose all touching fields (optional)
